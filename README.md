# RenameTo - it's utility for rename groups of files.


v.0.8 15/09/2017

Changed some architecture of program. You can edit config.txt and add some rules for renaming. It's easy to use.


v.0.2 12/09/2017

The first release I made for working renaming problems. Later I want to add universal architecture.

You can easily change the names of input files and output. Just see the class Segments. Folders with all files must be in the directory where RenameTo lies.
